# NVR Template

[Neutralino](https://neutralino.js.org) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) + [React](https://react.dev) Minimalist Template.

So called the NVR template. Just fork the project and start coding. Hope this little project saves you some time.

# Features

- Neutralino native API client pre-installed
- Vite configured to serve React in JavaScript syntax
- HMR just works

Tweak the `neutralino.config.json` and `vite.config.js` to adapt to your needs.
